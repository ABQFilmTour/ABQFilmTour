# ABQ Film Tour

ABQ Film Tour is an Android app that uses city provided film permit data to populate a map of locations in the city featured in movies and television series such as "Breaking Bad" and "Better Call Saul". Additional locations and further information about such locations are user submitted. The goal is to facilitate a self-guided tour of these locations throughout the city for tourists or film enthusiasts.
